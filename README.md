🚀 NCO Semantic Search Engine:

A Semantic Search Engine built for the NCO Statathon Project, integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Vector Databases, and Speech-to-Text to enable fast and intelligent query search.
📌 Features

🔎 Semantic Search
Uses FAISS vector database with transformer embeddings to retrieve results based on meaning, not just keywords.

🗂️ Hybrid Storage
Supports both Vector Database (FAISS) and Relational Database (SQLite .db) for flexibility.

🎙️ Voice Query Support
Integrated with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API for voice input.

📚 NLP-Powered Search
Uses HuggingFace Transformers + NLTK preprocessing for accurate semantic similarity.

🖥️ Streamlit Frontend
Provides an intuitive web dashboard with search bar, voice input, and result visualization.

⚡ Fast & Scalable
Optimized with FAISS for real-time query responses.


🚀 Key Advantages for Job Search :

Beyond Keywords → Finds jobs even if exact words differ for e.g (“ML Intern” ≈ “AI Research Trainee”).

Personalized Recommendations → Matches resume/profile with relevant jobs.

Faster Filtering → Uses hybrid FAISS + SQLite for semantic + structured search.

Voice Support → Enables quick job searches without typing.

Scalable → Can handle large-scale job databases efficiently.
